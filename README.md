# A sample flask project deployed on AWS EBS, Load balancer setup for HTTP & HTTPS, Route 53, Custom domain name, and SSL certificate installed.

## Project Description

This project is a sample Flask application that showcases a robust deployment setup on AWS (Amazon Web Services). It includes:

- Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EBS)
- Load balancer configuration to support both HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- Seamless integration with AWS Route 53 for managing DNS and a custom domain name (ahmadshen.tk)
- Implementation of an SSL certificate for enhanced security

This demonstrates a complete end-to-end deployment process with modern web technologies.
